Asteroids
=========

This is a pure JavaScript implementation of [Asteroids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). The player
can rotate the ship (left and right arrow keys), boost forward (forward key),
and fire bullets (spacebar) at asteroids. The asteroids will break apart on
impact. 

To play, simply download the files and run the index.html file in your browser.
