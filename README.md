Asteroids
=========

This is a pure JavaScript implementation of [Asteroids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). 
The player can rotate the ship (left and right arrow keys), boost forward (forward key), and fire bullets 
(spacebar) at asteroids. Asteroid shapes are randomly generated so that every asteroid is unique. The asteroids 
will also break apart on impact. 

To play, simply download the files and run the index.html file in your browser.
